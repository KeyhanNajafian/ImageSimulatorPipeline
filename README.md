### Code configuration and run:
To implement the code we used Python version 3.9, and a version of the packages can be installed through installing all the required packages.

1. In order to install the required packages please run the following command using `pip`: 
   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
> In order to run each python script you first need to change the related configuration file in the `config/` folder for each file.

2. In order to extract frames from videos:
   1. Change the configuration file named **frames_extractor.yaml** in the **configs/** folder.  
   2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
      python3 frames_extractor.py --config configs/frames_extractor.yaml
   ```       
3. In order to extract real and fake objects from the segmented representative image:
   1. Change the configuration file named **objects_extractor.yaml** in the **configs/** folder. 
   2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
      python3 objects_extractor.py --config configs/objects_extractor.yaml
   ```  
4. In order to simulate the dataset using the previously extracted background frames and real and fake objects:
   1. Change the configuration file named **simulation.yaml** in the **configs/** folder. 
   2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
      python3 simulation.py --config configs/simulation.yaml
   ```
